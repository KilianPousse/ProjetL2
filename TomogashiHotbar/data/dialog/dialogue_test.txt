Haricot#Time to shine and I'm down to ride. I'm gonna drive until the break of dawn, wilding out. I'm on a mission grinding out. Whatever it is I gotta do. Riding out until the day I meet you. I'm riding out.
Risette#I look up in the sky. Asking lotta. But never let it phase me, I'm keeping good vibes. When I'm on the road, I watch out for all surprises. What it provides us. Good and bad but nothing unties us.
Haricot#Another wander in the night. Let me paint the view. Colour a town with my light. For every moment shared with you. Not out in the day. But never fully gone. Going to be back again. Until the coming of a dawn.
Py#For all the days ahead of us put your hands up. Wave 'em side to side for good luck, ah. For all the nights like this, put your hands up. Love the moment even from dusk, yup. You always got my back, and of course I got your back Don't you worry about that now.
